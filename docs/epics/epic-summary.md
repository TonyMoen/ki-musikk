# Epic Summary

**8 Epics Delivering Incremental User Value:**

1. **Foundation & Infrastructure** - Project setup, deployment pipeline, core dependencies
2. **User Authentication & Credit System** - Users can sign up and purchase credits
3. **Norwegian Song Creation** - THE CORE: Users create authentic Norwegian songs with pronunciation optimization
4. **Song Library & Management** - Users manage their created songs
5. **Social Sharing & Viral Features** - Users share songs to drive organic growth
6. **Premium Features** - Canvas generation, mastering service, extended storage
7. **User Experience & Help** - Polish, guidance, tooltips, documentation
8. **System Resilience & Operations** - Error handling, monitoring, operational excellence

**Why This Structure:**
- ✅ Each epic delivers USER VALUE (not just technical capability)
- ✅ Epic 1 (Foundation) is acceptable greenfield exception
- ✅ Epic 3 combines pronunciation optimization with song creation (integrated core value)
- ✅ Incremental delivery: Users get value after each epic completion
- ✅ NO technical layer breakdown (database/API/frontend) - that's the WRONG pattern!
