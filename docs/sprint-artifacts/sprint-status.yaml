# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created by *epic-tech-context (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story

#   - done: Story completed by *story-done

#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
# - Recommended Sprint 1: Epic 1 (Foundation) - Stories 1.1 through 1.6
# - Recommended Sprint 2: Epic 2 (Auth & Credits) - Stories 2.1 through 2.6
# - Recommended Sprint 3-4: Epic 3 (Norwegian Song Creation) - Core value proposition
# - Epic 8 (Resilience) stories should be integrated throughout sprints, not saved for end
