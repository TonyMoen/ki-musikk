# Product Brief: norskmusikk

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Author:** Tony
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**norskmusikk** is an AI-powered song creation platform specifically optimized for Norwegian Bokmål, addressing the critical gap in authentic Norwegian music generation. The product enables amateur creators and entry-level artists to produce genuine-sounding Norwegian songs without requiring phonetic expertise or professional production resources.

**The Opportunity:**
Norwegian music creators currently face an insurmountable barrier: existing AI music tools like Suno produce Norwegian vocals that sound "very American, bad, and fake" due to phonetic mispronunciations. Manual workarounds require expert-level knowledge of phonetic spelling tricks. With zero Norwegian-specific competitors and a proven market (founder's 80k monthly Spotify listeners validates demand), norskmusikk has a clear 6-month first-mover advantage window.

**The Solution:**
norskmusikk intelligently orchestrates proven prompt engineering techniques (validated at 80k listener scale) with user-friendly phonetic controls to transform Suno's output from "American-sounding" to authentically Norwegian. The "Uttalelse Bokmål" phonetic toggle provides automatic pronunciation enhancement with visual diff preview and per-line override capability, giving users control over imperfect AI while dramatically improving quality.

**Target Market:**
- **Primary**: Party song creators (25-50 years old) making personalized Norwegian songs for weddings, birthdays, and family gatherings - amateurs seeking "good enough" quality quickly
- **Secondary**: Entry-level Spotify artists (18-35 years old) building Norwegian music catalogs with sub-10k listener goals

**Business Model:**
Pre-paid credit system with freemium model: 30-second free preview demonstrates value, full songs require credit purchase. Optional premium services (canvas generation, 24-hour manual mastering) create additional revenue streams. Target: 1,000 users with 10% conversion (100 paying customers) within 6 months, achieving $1,000+ MRR to cover infrastructure costs.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Productized Expertise**: Codifies founder's 80k-listener proven techniques into accessible software
2. **Norwegian-First Design**: Only platform optimized specifically for Norwegian pronunciation
3. **Economic Resilience**: Pre-paid credits create financial buffer for API dependencies
4. **User Control**: Phonetic toggle prevents algorithmic lock-in, handles edge cases gracefully

**Success Criteria:**
70% user satisfaction rating for Norwegian pronunciation quality (bar: "noticeably better than Suno alone"), 40% social sharing rate driving viral growth, and positive contribution margin within 3 months. Success enables Nordic expansion (Swedish, Danish markets) and positions norskmusikk as acquisition target for Spotify or Norwegian media companies.

**Strategic Advantage:**
First-mover data accumulation creates moat - Norwegian phonetic preferences and user insights become increasingly valuable and difficult for late entrants to replicate. Founder's proven 80k listener credibility and productized expertise provide quality edge that competitors cannot quickly replicate.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Norwegian music creators who want to use AI-powered song generation tools face a significant quality barrier: existing platforms like Suno AI are optimized for English and produce Norwegian vocals that sound "very American, bad, and fake." The primary issues are phonetic - incorrect pronunciation of Norwegian-specific sounds (rolled R's, vowel patterns, consonant clusters, stress patterns) that make AI-generated Norwegian music immediately recognizable as artificial and unsuitable for serious use.

**Impact:**
- Amateur creators cannot produce authentic-sounding Norwegian party songs for weddings, birthdays, and family gatherings without extensive manual lyric manipulation techniques
- Entry-level artists seeking to build a Spotify presence (sub-10k listener goal) lack accessible tools to create Norwegian music that sounds genuine
- Current workarounds require advanced knowledge of phonetic spelling tricks and prompt engineering - barriers too high for mainstream users
- The Norwegian music creation market remains underserved despite proven demand (evidenced by founder's 80k monthly Spotify listeners using manual techniques)

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- **Suno AI**: No Norwegian language optimization; requires expert-level phonetic manipulation to achieve acceptable results
- **Generic AI music tools**: English-centric; no consideration for Norwegian linguistic characteristics
- **Professional music production**: Too expensive and time-consuming for casual party songs or entry-level artists
- **No Norwegian-specific competitors**: Market gap with zero direct competition

**Why Now:**
- AI music generation technology has matured to the point where language-specific optimization is viable
- Norwegian consumer market demonstrates willingness to pay for localized SaaS tools
- First-mover advantage window exists before international competitors add Norwegian support
- Proven market validation through founder's existing 80k monthly listener Spotify presence demonstrates demand for authentic Norwegian AI music

## Proposed Solution

**norskmusikk** is an AI-powered song creation platform specifically optimized for Norwegian Bokmål, enabling amateur creators and entry-level artists to generate authentic-sounding Norwegian music without requiring phonetic expertise.

**Core Approach:**
The solution leverages proven prompt engineering techniques (validated through the founder's 80k monthly listener Spotify success) combined with user-facing phonetic controls to transform Suno AI's output from "American-sounding" to genuinely Norwegian. Rather than building AI models from scratch, norskmusikk intelligently orchestrates existing APIs (Suno, GPT-4, Gemini, Google Video) with Norwegian-specific optimization layers.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Phonetic Intelligence**: "Uttalelse Bokmål" toggle automatically applies Norwegian pronunciation rules with visual diff preview and per-line override capability
2. **Productized Expertise**: Codifies the founder's proven techniques (80k monthly listeners) into accessible software
3. **Norwegian-First Design**: Every feature designed for Norwegian language and culture, not retrofitted from English
4. **Economic Resilience**: Pre-paid credit system creates financial buffer for service recovery during API outages
5. **Premium Enhancement Options**: Optional canvas generation and professional mastering service differentiate from raw Suno access

**User Experience Vision:**
Users input their Norwegian lyrics and song concept → norskmusikk applies phonetic optimization (with user review/override) → generates high-quality Norwegian vocals via Suno → optional canvas visual generation → optional 24-hour human mastering service. The entire flow is designed for non-technical amateurs who want "just works" quality without understanding the underlying phonetic engineering.

**Why This Will Succeed:**
- **First-mover advantage**: Zero Norwegian AI music competitors
- **Proven techniques**: Not speculative - already working at 80k listener scale
- **Low quality bar**: Only needs to be "noticeably better than Suno alone" for 70% satisfaction
- **Natural viral distribution**: Party songs shared on TikTok/Facebook create organic discovery
- **Sustainable economics**: Pre-paid credits prevent cost exposure from traffic spikes

  - Built-in TypeScript support
  - Deployed as Vercel Serverless Functions automatically
- **API Integrations**:
  - **sunoapi.org** (third-party Suno API wrapper for music generation)
    - Cost: 12 credits per generation = $0.06 per song
    - Note: Official Suno API not publicly available; using sunoapi.org as intermediary
    - Supports models V3.5, V4, V4.5, V4.5PLUS, V5
    - 99.9% uptime guarantee
    - Webhook support for async completion
  - OpenAI GPT-4 (lyrics processing, enhancement)
  - Google Gemini (image generation prompts)
  - Google Video API (canvas generation)
  - Stripe API (payment processing)

**Database & Infrastructure:**
- **Supabase** (all-in-one platform):
  - PostgreSQL database (user accounts, credit balances, song metadata)
  - Authentication (Google OAuth)
  - Storage (audio files, canvas images with 14-day retention)
  - Real-time subscriptions (if needed for collaborative features later)
- **Alternative consideration**: PlanetScale/Neon (PostgreSQL) + Vercel Blob Storage if Supabase limits hit
  - Pro: More control, potentially cheaper at scale
  - Con: More services to manage
  - Recommendation: Start with Supabase, migrate only if needed

**Deployment & Hosting:**
- **Platform**: Vercel (primary recommendation)
  - Single deployment for entire Next.js app (frontend + API routes)
  - Automatic serverless function deployment for API routes
  - Built-in CDN for static assets
  - Preview deployments for every Git branch
  - Zero-config deployment (`vercel deploy`)
- **Alternative**: Netlify (also supports Next.js)
  - Similar features to Vercel
  - Slightly different pricing model
- **Domain**: norskmusikk.no (Norwegian TLD for local credibility)

### Architecture Considerations

**API Orchestration Pattern (Next.js API Routes):**
- API routes serve as intelligent proxy layer between frontend and external APIs
- Server-side execution ensures API keys never exposed to browser
- Encapsulates business logic (credit checks, atomic transactions)
- Implements rate limiting and cost controls via middleware
- Handles retries and fallback logic for API failures
- Example flow:
  ```
  User clicks "Generate Song"
       ↓
  Frontend calls /api/songs/generate
       ↓
  Next.js API Route (server-side):
    1. Verify user authentication (Supabase)
    2. Check credit balance (PostgreSQL)
    3. Call sunoapi.org with API key
    4. Deduct credits atomically
    5. Register webhook for completion
       ↓
  Return task ID to frontend
  ```

**Credit System Architecture:**
- Atomic transactions for credit deduction (prevent double-charging)
- Rollback on API failure (user not charged if song generation fails)
- Audit log for all credit transactions (debugging and support)
- Pre-paid model eliminates recurring billing complexity

**Session & State Management:**
- Track list persisted to database (survives browser refresh/API failures)
- Optimistic UI updates with backend confirmation
- Graceful degradation if realtime features unavailable

**File Storage Strategy:**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate download from sunoapi.org required (they auto-delete after 3 days)
- Generated audio files transferred to Supabase Storage immediately after generation
- 14-day auto-deletion policy (cost management and user expectation setting)
- Signed URLs for secure download (no public file access)
- Metadata stored in PostgreSQL (song title, credits used, generation timestamp, sunoapi.org task ID)
- Third-party dependency: Must monitor sunoapi.org reliability and have fallback strategy

**Security Considerations:**
- API keys stored in environment variables (never committed to source control)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (prevent abuse)
- Input sanitization for user-provided lyrics
- Stripe webhooks for payment verification (prevent fraudulent credit additions)
- HTTPS everywhere (TLS encryption)

**Scalability Approach (MVP Simplicity):**
- Serverless architecture handles traffic spikes automatically
- Database connection pooling (Supabase handles)
- Defer complex optimization until traffic validates need
- Monitor API costs closely; implement circuit breakers if costs spike unexpectedly

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Error tracking: Sentry or similar
- Analytics: Plausible or PostHog (privacy-friendly, GDPR-compliant)
- API monitoring: Track Suno/GPT-4 response times and error rates
- Cost monitoring: Daily alerts if API spend exceeds thresholds

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

**Financial Constraints:**
- Bootstrap/founder-funded model (no external investment for MVP)
- Limited API testing budget (~$500)
- Infrastructure costs must stay under $500/month until revenue covers expenses
- Credit pricing must achieve 60-70% contribution margin to be sustainable

**Time Constraints:**
- 2-3 month MVP development timeline target [NEEDS CONFIRMATION]
- Solo founder or very small team (limited development velocity)
- Must launch before competitors recognize Norwegian market opportunity (6-month window)

**Resource Constraints:**
- Founder handling development, marketing, and operations initially
- Manual mastering service limited by founder availability (24h SLA is constraint)
- No dedicated QA team for MVP (founder testing + early beta users)

**Technical Constraints:**

- sunoapi.org = additional third-party layer (not direct Suno access); no control over pricing, reliability, or model changes
- Cannot control Suno model quality or changes (reactive quality management only)
- sunoapi.org files auto-delete after 3 days (must download immediately to Supabase)
- Storage costs require 14-day deletion policy to manage expenses

**Market Constraints:**
- Norwegian market size relatively small (~5.5 million population)
- Bilingual market (English UI acceptable, reduces localization burden)
- Payment friction if Vipps not included (deferred to post-MVP)

**Legal/Regulatory Constraints:**
- GDPR compliance required for EU/Norwegian users
- Norwegian copyright law applies to AI-generated music (validated as permissible)
- Terms of Service must disclaim music rights and quality guarantees

- sunoapi.org pricing remains stable at current $0.06/song rate
- Prompt engineering alone can achieve 70%+ satisfaction for Norwegian pronunciation
- Supabase infrastructure can handle MVP scale (thousands of users)
- 14-day storage retention sufficient for user needs (users download within 2 weeks)
- sunoapi.org 3-day file retention doesn't cause file loss (immediate download to Supabase)
- Third-party API costs predictable enough for pre-paid credit pricing

**Business Assumptions:**
- 10% free-to-paid conversion rate achievable
- Users purchase credits 2-3 times (not one-off)
- Organic social sharing can drive 20% of user acquisition
- Founder's 80k listener credibility attracts early adopters
- Manual mastering service creates differentiation worth premium pricing

**Financial Assumptions:**
- sunoapi.org cost: **$0.06 per song** (12 credits × $0.005/credit) - VALIDATED
- sunoapi.org pricing remains stable (no unilateral increases)
- GPT-4/Gemini costs remain low (<$0.05 per request)
- Average revenue per user (ARPU) of $10-20/month achievable
- Break-even at 100-200 paying users
- Infrastructure scales linearly with user growth (no step-function cost increases)

## Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks

**Technical Risks:**
1. **Third-Party API Wrapper Dependency (sunoapi.org)** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Risk: sunoapi.org could increase prices (12 credits per song currently), shut down service, lose Suno access, or experience extended outages
   - Impact: Entire music generation capability depends on third-party intermediary (not direct Suno access)
   - Mitigation: Pre-paid credit buffer provides financial cushion, monitor official Suno API availability, have migration plan ready if official API becomes available, maintain sunoapi.org alternative provider research
   - Note: Official Suno API not currently publicly available; sunoapi.org is only viable option

2. **Pronunciation Quality Degradation** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Risk: Suno model updates (pushed through sunoapi.org) worsen Norwegian pronunciation without advance warning
   - Impact: No early access to model changes; reactive rather than proactive quality management
   - Mitigation: Test team for rapid quality detection, maintain prompt libraries for multiple Suno model versions (V3.5, V4, V4.5, V5), continuous prompt iteration, user feedback monitoring

3. **Third-Party API Cost Increases** (MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT)
   - Risk: sunoapi.org unilaterally increases pricing (currently $0.06/song), reducing contribution margin or forcing user price increases
   - Mitigation: Pre-paid credit model allows gradual price adjustments, cost monitoring alerts, evaluate alternative providers if pricing becomes unsustainable

**Market Risks:**
1. **Competitor Entry** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Risk: International AI music platforms add Norwegian optimization before we establish market position
   - Mitigation: 6-month launch window, build user data moat quickly, founder's proven 80k listener credibility

2. **Market Size Insufficient** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Risk: Norwegian market too small to sustain business at target pricing
   - Mitigation: Validate with MVP metrics (1,000 users, 10% conversion), Nordic expansion plan ready

3. **Willingness-to-Pay Lower Than Expected** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Risk: Users unwilling to pay premium over free Suno access
   - Mitigation: Founder's 80k listeners prove value exists, adjust pricing based on conversion data

**Business/Operational Risks:**
1. **Founder Availability (Mastering SLA)** (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Risk: Cannot deliver 24h mastering during illness/unavailability
